## Problem Description
There are n bowls, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, bowl i container mi marbles. One game step consists of removing one marble from a bowl. When removing a marble from bowl i (i > 1), one marble is added to each of the first i-1 bowls; if a marble is removed from bowl 1, no new marble is added. The game is finished after each bowl is empty.

Your job is to determine how many game steps are needed to finish the game. You may assume that the supply of marbles is sufficient, and each bowl is large enough, so that each possible game step can be executed.
